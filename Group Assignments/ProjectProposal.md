# **Group Assignment #1: Project Proposal**

### An introduction of your research question
In this research project, we will analyze public transit access to 17 Regional Recreation Parks in LA County. We will see which neighborhoods can access those recreation areas in a trip of 45 minutes or less of walking and public transit, and which forms of public transit are available to them. These 17 parks are the parks in LA County that each encompass over 100 acres and contain 3 or more active amenities, such as swimming pools or athletic fields. 
We selected these parks because they draw users from across the county; sometimes drawing people from over 25 miles away. In this way, we’re using this definition of parks as a proxy for the most heavily used parks. Since users can live so far from these parks, they raise the question of how people get to the parks. Additionally, our research project has grown out of the LA Parks Needs Assessment project, which examined access to parks based on walking distance. That project inventoried over 3,000 parks and open spaces across the county, and divided them into four categories: Local Parks, Regional Recreation Parks, Regional Open Spaces, and Natural Areas. We selected the Regional Recreation Parks category for our analysis based on the reasoning above.

### An explanation of why it is important to you, why it matters to others, and what is at stake 
There is extensive and widely documented evidence about inequities in neighborhood park access along the lines of race, socioeconomic status, and education level in cities across the country. Neither the City of LA nor the larger LA County are exempt from this. As a result of these inequities, many LA residents living in lower-income communities of color must travel to access parks that are larger, better maintained, and have more amenities. However, low-income households tend to have less access to cars and tend to take shorter trips by car than middle- or high-income households. This suggests that public transit routes to well-maintained parks are crucial for low-income households.
Park access supports physical and mental health in a number of direct and indirect ways. In parks, residents can use the space and facilities for physical activity, enjoy the physiological and mental benefits of being around trees and greenery, gather with friends and family to support their social wellbeing, and so much more. For low-income households, parks serve to replace the yards and play spaces they lack in their homes. Parks have become a particularly essential facility during the COVID-19 pandemic, as residents have flocked to parks to escape their homes, exercise, or more safely socialize. Paralleling the inequitable distribution of parks, COVID-19 disproportionately impacts low-income communities and communities of color. Equitable park access takes on new urgency to ensure that these communities have safe recreation options to combat the physical, mental, and social toll of the COVID-19 pandemic.

### A description of the spatial scope (e.g. Boyle Heights or Hong Kong), and why space and/or time matters for your project
This research project will focus on the selected 17 parks across LA County. We chose to consider LA County as a whole, rather than just the City of LA, because the LA region is highly interconnected, and residents frequently travel across city lines to reach work, school, and leisure destinations across the county. Furthermore, much of LA County’s public transportation system is regional rather than limited to a single city.

### A preliminary but definitive description of data sources (at least two) that you will use 

*LA County: County-wide Parks and Open Space:* https://egis-lacounty.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/countywide-parks-and-open-space-public-hosted/

This data set provides information on the 3,000+ parks and open spaces in LA County, including their size, facilities, and coordinates. After sorting by type (NDS_AN_TYPE), we can extract the 17 regional recreation parks that we’re studying and use the coordinates and shape provided.
