** Hello World! **

Katrina and I are two Masters in Urban Planning students at UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs! This is documentation of our UP206 class project where we investigated transit park access in LA County. This is important right now because during the COVID19 pandemic people are more reliant on open spaces to manage physical and mental health. For these reasons we researched inequities in distribution of public space via transit based upon prior research done by the LA Needs Assessment.
