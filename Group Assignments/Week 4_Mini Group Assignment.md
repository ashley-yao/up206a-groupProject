# Mini Group Assignment

For this week's group assignment, meet with your partner and submit a status report as a markdown file in your group repo. This will simply be graded as a "done" or "not done" and count towards your participation grade.

Include the following sections:

Project title and link to proposal

Roles (only for groups): Give each team member a title, and define what role each team member will play, and how each person plans to contribute to the project. While this may be subject to change, it is a good idea to define this early in the project to clarify "who is doing what."
Katrina - Public Issues Officer: taking the lead on overarching project goal and parks aims
Ashley - Chief Transit Officer: taking the lead on the transit mapping aspect

Status update: Report on the general mood of the team, and provide details as to what is working, and what is not.
